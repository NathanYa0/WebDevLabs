        I grew up in Cupertino, California with two older brothers. When I was yough i loved to play soccer and video games. Though I no longer play soccer, I still love playing video games and have picked up poker and other board games. I later moved to Sunnnyvale, California to attend my middle and high school.
        I did a lot of community service and environmental projects in highschool, which have contributed to my interpersonal and professional skillset.
